# Hello Sim API

This is a group of protos that are used to communicate with Hello Sim, currently we are only working on a C++ Client, but if you want to extend that to a java or python client you can use this

## Flow
```
      Conn
Client -> server
```

Client sends connection to server, server accepts.
